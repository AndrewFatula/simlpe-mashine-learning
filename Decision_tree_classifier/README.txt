Here you can find implementation of the classification decision tree algorithm from scratch using Python and additional libraries Pandas and Numpy.

Decision_tree_classifier.py - classification decision tree model, trained and tested on some data from the internet that contains 50000 values of 1 label and 13 features, 
that data you can find in data directory.

compute_tree - funcion that builds tree recursively, the main principle of building tree is findind specific value of one of the given features that separates classes the most.

In finding split value was used the concept of information enropy.
